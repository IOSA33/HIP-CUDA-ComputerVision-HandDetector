# How to Start CPU side
- Put your image in the "photos" folder
- Then in the ```main.cpp``` change the path to the image file
- After, to run the code write in console
```
mkdir build
cmake ..
ninja
./app.exe 1
```
# How to Start GPU side
- Put your image in the "photos" folder
- Then go to the hip folder, after in the ```main.hip.cpp``` change the path to the file
- To run the code write in console, in hip folder
```
hipcc main.hip.cc -o app
./app.exe 1
